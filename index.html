        <h3>Rhye</h3>
        <p>
          Rhye is a Canadian musical group led by vocalist Mike Molish. Known
          for his 'angelic' voice, Molish makes great use of instrumental talent
          to provide a downtempo, alternative R&B, funk, and jazzy vibe. All of
          their albums are worth a listen but some of Rhye's best songs in my
          opinion are 'Taste', 'Count to Five', 'The Fall', 'Hold You Down',
          'Stay Safe', 'My Heart Bleeds', and 'Holy'.
